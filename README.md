# IncomeCalculator

IncomeCalculator is a web-service in **C# ASP.NET Core** to monitor and manage emloyees salaries/wages, their workflow and working hours.</br>
This project is a pseudo api generator. I've used it to better understand API flow.</br>
Project creates self-maintained api generator of data (employee, timeLog), while other controllers fetch the data and calculate salary, workflow etc.</br>
Simple CRUD actions to add yourself an employee and get his calculated salary.</br>
Everything is visible by Razor-Pages and Bootstrap to maintain simplicity of the project.</br>
In-short: API generates data, that is fethed and gone through other controllers.</br>

Everything is segregated up to simple MVC pattern: (Services, Repos, Models), View, Controllers
